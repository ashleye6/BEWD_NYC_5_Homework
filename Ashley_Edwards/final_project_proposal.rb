Overview: I want to build a web app that allows users to search for schools based on school budget information. 

Why: I work in education and believe all stakeholders (teachers, administrators, students, parents, regulating bodies) should be aware of how schools are budgeting state/federal money to serve children. 

Where: Because I could only find an API for Philadelphia school budgets, this app will only cover that area. API here -> http://phillyschools.info/

The User Experince:
1. User signs into site or uses FB log-in
2. User can search for schools based on Total Spending per Pupil, Administrator Salaries, $ spent on Textbooks, etc.
3. The search returns back schools that fall into that category, along with their full budget information.
4. Users can leave comments on the school budgets as they view them.

Some features that might be cool:
* Letting users leave comments with the option to post on Facebook or Twitter
* Allowing users to make comparisons of schools
* Allowing users to compare school budget info with school performance data
* Option for users to email the school board of specific schools for questions regarding budgeting

The idea is still taking shape, but this is what I am thinking so far.
