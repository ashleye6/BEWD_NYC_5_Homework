I'm looking at 2 different projects: a) an extension of Shazam, and b) an app similar to foursquare. 

a) For the Shazam project, I want to be add the ability to:
  1) see if I have tagged a song more than once
  2) keep track of the number of times I have tagged a song
  3) be able to filter all songs tagged by: 
    i) artist
    ii) album
    iii) genre (maybe)
  4) be mobile friendly (maybe)

I found a site called echoprint.me which is supposed to be an open source music identification system.  This brought me to https://github.com/youpy/ruby-echonest/tree/master.  I still have to read through everything.  I'm just worried that since it's not popular, there won't be much documentation to help me get through it all.  

b) For the app similar to foursquare, I want to call it "Find Your Happy Place." The goal is for users to keep track of places that spark happy memories, so that they can go back and/or share with friends.  I want it to be able to: 
  1) check-in users at a location (current or specified)
  2) allow users to tag locations by:
    i) food
    ii) drink
    iii) sights
    iv) etc.
  3) allow users to add a note (what they saw, what they ate, who they were with)
  4) count number of tags
  5) allow a privacy function (maybe)
  6) be mobile friendly (maybe)

  I haven't used foursquare before.  Is it possible to use a facebook api/gem?  I'm just worried that I might be taking too much on with this project.
