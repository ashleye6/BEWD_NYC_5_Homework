#Final Project Proposal
##Overview
A web application that allows you to order from highly rated restaurants in your current location.

###Background
There are a few areas in which I think the major players (Seamless and Grubhub) can improve.  First, the UI.  Neither are optimized for mobile use, both feel clunky and heavy.  The amount of options they give can be overwhelming.  I want to display only highly rated restaurants (4.5 - 5).  Possible api's: foursquare, yelp, zagat (monthly charge, probably not worth it?).  I'd also like to use the [ordr.in] api, which is an open source ordering platform.

###Primary Goals

1. Create home page
2. Create static pages (about, contact) 
4. Gather search results from chosen api
5. Integrate [ordr.in] api for ordering/payment functionality.
6. Create lightweight UI (Mobile & Desktop)

#####Future Goals
1. Add group ordering functionality
2. Implement local rating system
3. Use Zagat ratings
